This experiment is to show Cython is more than Python and adds optional typing. 
When you cythonize a Python function the performance skyrockets if you define the type

version1: pure python code, which takes 12 seconds.

version2: put the Python function in a pyx file and then use a setup.py file to cythonize the Python code.
          No type specification in the pyx function.


version3: add type specification in the pyx function. It takes 0.06 seconds.



How to run:
    run the timing.sh
