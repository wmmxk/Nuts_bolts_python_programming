Suppose you working on a python project, you structure your codes like this.

1. client folder holds the code you will run directly.
2. libs holds all the helper functions, class definition and so on.

1. How to import code from the libs to the code in client folder?
   You added the project home directory to the PYTHON PATH in every client by importing the _init_paths.

   Then you client code can import all the modules in the subfolder of the project folder using explicit import 

2. Well in the libs, when a moudle use code in another lib, say lib2, lib3, you can use relate import after you add the project_path to PYTHONPATH
